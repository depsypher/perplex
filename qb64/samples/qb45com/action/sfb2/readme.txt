+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Intro

SFB2: Vector Warriors is a Fighting game coded in QBASIC Extended. Unlike other BASIC fighting games that
look bad, play bad and are deleted often, I slaved over SFB2 untill I had a game that's fun and easy to play yet
unique. 
It's not another wanna-be Mortal Kombat (Which I personally don't like as a game). 

Tutorial 
By visiting the Dojo you can get some step by step on how to play. This is very helpful to new players and is highly
recommended.


+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Game Mechanics Brief

Two fighters get put in a given stage and beat the piss out of each other until one of them wins the match or is
dead. 
Matches are best out of three rounds. When one of the fighters KO the other they win the round. 
On some stages the fighters may step out of the ring resulting in a Ring Out. This may result in the opponent
winning the round or some kind of an ass kicking. 
In the event of a death, the fighter still living wins the match regardless of how many rounds anyone has won.


+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Basic Control

Q & W are Punches 
A & S are Kicks 

The Cursor Keys mimic those on the number pad. Although it's recommended you don't use them since they lack
Left & Right Jumps. 

Special Moves

Press the E key to enable Specials. When these are enabled all four of your attack keys have different, more powerful effects. However these will drain you more then normal moves. The Special moves your fighter can use are determined by the type of Hands and Feet a fighter has. 

Rage & Supers

During the match each fighter sustains more and more Rage toward their opponent. This is displayed by the bar
at the bottom of the screen. 
When a fighter is at their maximum Rage they can release it in the form of a Super. Do so by pressing D. Supers are determined by Body type.

Performance: 

A Pentium is highly recommended to run at an acceptable speed. 
SFB2 has only been tested under Windows 9x however, it run may run up to twice as fast in DOS [Mode]. 
A writable C:\ is needed for a path info file, however this file is not required. 
100% Sound Blaster Compatible sound cards are also supported but only using standard settings. 



DOS Mode VS. Win9x:

Running the game in DOS can greatly improve it's speed. The down side is you may not have enough conventional memory to run it and you may not get any sound. 
Win9x runs slower but has much less hassle and generally supplies the memory required.
