	ASSAULT.BAS   - Program File
	ASSAULT.CFG   - Configuration file

Installation:

Just put these files in your qbasic programs folder.  Make sure the WAV and BCK files are in their appropriate folders
within the root directory.  You must then edit the program file to change the line:

	CHDIR "c:\glenn\qb45\assault"

to whatever directory you put the program in.
Then run it and enjoy.


Game Play:

This is a game of weapons and destruction that relies upon the properties of physics as well as your skill.
There can be up to 4 players on up to 4 teams playing at one time.  Each player controls a tank that is equiped with 
various weapons.  You can set the amount of ammo for each of these devices in the Configuration.  You can also use
the Configuration to set the amount of health you start with, player names, teams, control keys, and other options.

At the top of the screen is the current player's info bar.  At the left side is the player's name.  To the right, is
that player's health meter.  Right of the meter is a long rectangle with an arrow underneith it.  The rectangle is the
player's fire power meter.  The arrow is the current wind factor (Wind affects projectiles, but not players jumping).
At the far right is a picture of the player's current weapon selection.  To the left of this image is the amount of ammo
for the selected weapon.  Under the weapon's image is the current setting number for that weapon.

You move your tank with the Left and Right keys.  You can adjust you gun's aim with the Up and Down keys.  To select
a weapon you can press F1 through F7.  Once you select a weapon you can adjust the setting on it
by pressing 1, 2, or 3.  Here is a chart showing each weapon and what the setting is used for:

+-----+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Key	| Weapon		| Description			| Setting				|
+-----+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| F1	| Cannon		| Basic cannon			| # of bullets per fire *	|
+-----+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| F2	| Grenade		| Grennade that bounces	 	| # of sec's before detonation|
+-----+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| F3	| Mine		| Trip mine			 	| Distance to be tripped  **	|
+-----+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| F4	| Digger		| Strange digging bullet 	| Nothing				| <- I want to get rid of these.
+-----+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+    They don't usually work.
| F5	| Flame Thrower	| Frys anything in it's way	| Length of flame			|
+-----+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| F6	| Booster Jump	| You can jump in the air	| Nothing (Maybe later)		|
+-----+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| F7	| Cluster Bomb	| Explodes into bullets	 	| # of bullets *			|
+-----+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+

	* The explosions from these weapons are larger if the setting # is smaller
	** The benefit from a smaller trip radius is it will inflict more damage because it's closer to the player

The Fire key launches each weapon except the Booster jump.  To jump use the Jump key and then hit it again while
you are in the air to get another boost (You must have the Booster Jump readied, so hit F6).

For the projectile weapons (Cannon, grenade, digger, and cluster), you hit the Fire key once and then a meter in the info
bar will immediately start to go up.  Hit Fire again to launch the projectile with the force of the meter (If you let the
meter go all the way up, it will automatically fire with full force).

There are various environments to fight in.  You can also make your own for levels to fight in.  If you
can't figure out how to do this, e-mail me (powell98@pacbell.net) for instructions.  I have included an example level
called "HILL", so check it out (Only edit the HILL.LVL file, the "HILL.TRF" is a BSAVE image).
You can also e-mail me for any questions, comments, or just to chat.  I can help you to make changes such as new weapons
which are actually really easy to implement.

<!!! WARNING !!!>
If the game uses too much memory, I have another low-grade version that uses a lot less.  There are no background images,
or high-quality sounds, but it is still fun.  E-mail me for more info.


Known Tweaks:

(Sorry my code isn't commented, but I will comment it soon)

- The grenades and player jumping work decently, but it would be nice if they worked better.

- The digger needs a lot of work, but if you can figure this one out on your own, you are a god!  E-mail me for some
tips and ideas.

- E-mail me any other bugs that you find.

Thanks, have fun!
