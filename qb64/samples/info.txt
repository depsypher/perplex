This folder contains a repository of QBASIC/QB64 source which runs in QB64

The qb64\samples\qb64\original\ folder contains samples provided with QB64 up to (and including) V0.83
The example programs contained there are not listed below, refer to qb64\samples\qb64\original\samples.txt for more information about them.

Only QBASIC programs which run WITH NO MODIFICATIONS are added to this repository with the following exceptions:
-Changes to make the program's path correct if required
-Changes to the speed at which the program runs
(The only exception to this rule is wetspot.bas, in which case the minor change is explained)

QB64 programs will be added to this repository later. They will contain a /64 tag.
