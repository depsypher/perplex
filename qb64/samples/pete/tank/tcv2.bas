'               Game Name:  Qbasic TANK COMMANDER version 2
'                   Programmer:  Matthew River Knight
'                     Completed:  August 15, 1999
'
'
'This game is a remake of the last TANK COMMANDER, having been improved and
'modified a great deal. The sprites now move very fluidly and without any
'flicker on 286 PCs and up. The code is also alot smaller than the last
'version and has been made as readable and easy to edit as possible.
'
'                               * * * *
'
'This is a two player game in which you and a friend drive about the arena
'in tanks trying to blow eachother up. You both have very powerfull tanks
'capable of driving through anything in your path. Even the most secure of
'fortresses stands no chance against these armoured beasts. Each of the tanks
'is equipt with powerfull bomb launchers, capable of blowing up the other
'tank beyond repair, with a single strike.
'
'The keys for the game are pretty standard, and have been designed to allow
'both players to play at the same keyboard without getting in eachothers way.
'You MUST ensure that NUMLOCK is ON before running the game !!! The keys
'are as follows:
'
'BLUE TANK  - up:  8
'             down:  2
'             left:  4
'             right:  6
'             brakes:  5
'             shoot:  0
'
'GREEN TANK - up:  Q
'             down:  A
'             left:  O
'             right:  P
'             brakes:  S
'             shoot:  SPACE BAR
'
'                               * * * *
'
'The graphics for this game have been BSAVEd, and thus have to be loaded
'directly into memory to be drawn. This presents quite a problem because
'Qbasic often has quite a bit of trouble locating files that need to be
'BLOADed. This problem may be corrected by reffering to line 122 where there
'is a CHDIR. All you have to do is type the directory in which this game
'resides into the "" marks.
'
'Another potential problem with this game is the delay loop, which controls
'how fast the program runs. This game was designed on a computer using a
'CYRIX MII300 CPU, a 4MB graphics accelerator card and 512K cache - your
'computer may be faster or slower, and thus, for example, if you have a
'PENTIUM III, clocked at 500MHZ, this game will run so fast that it will be
'unplayable.
'
'This problem could have been eliminated by adding a CPU independant delay
'into the code by testing how fast your CPU is, however this presents us with
'another problem: different versions of Qbasic tend to give different results
'for these kinds of tests, and thus the game would have run inconsistantly
'on different platforms, even if they were being run on exactly the same
'kind of system. Since I wanted this game to be playable on any version of
'Qbasic, I chose to let everybody set the delay loop themselves.
'
'The delay loop variable is on line 125, under the name of Speed. All you
'have to do is change what it is = to. The default setting is 550 which is
'perfect for my system when running the game under WINDOWS 95 and on a Qbasic
'4.5 platform. Just experiment with the setting until the game runs at a
'speed with which you are satisfied. Just remember that the lower the number
'Speed is = to, the faster the game is going to run!
'
'                               * * * *
'
'This game has been programmed from scratch by Matthew River Knight. All the
'code here is my own, with the exception of the FADE IN/OUT code which was
'kindly provided by Manny Najera of FLASH GAMES, on his web site. Any code
'that you find usefull in this game may be taken. The graphics files used
'in this game may not be taken, however. Please give this game to anybody,
'and everybody, though if you do, please DO NOT give them a modified version,
'and DO NOT remove this text! I spent ages making the code the way it is and
'personally I am very proud of it. Please leave it as it is!
