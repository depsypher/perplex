C14       Using Online Help

          The online Help system
          provides information on all
          aspects of the PIXELplus 256
          environment, including the
          Image Editor, Animation
          Tester and Screen Designer.

          To get help on any feature
          of PIXELplus 256, select
          Contents from the Help menu,
          or press F1. This will
          display the online Help
          Table of Contents, a
          categorized list of subjects
          for which help is available.
          Alternatively, select Index
          from the Help menu to

          of all Help topics. Next,
          click on a Help item (shown
          in magenta) to view help on
          that subject. Also, a list
          of related topics will often

          text; click on any of these
          items to view information on
          that topic.

          Many subjects provide more
          text than can be displayed
          on a single "page" so a
          scroll bar is provided (on
          the right side of the Help
          dialog box).

          The Table of Contents and
          Index can be viewed at any
          time by clicking on the
          appropriate button, at the
          bottom of the Help dialog
          box.

          1) Click on a menu name to
          open the menu, then click on
          the required menu command.
          To close the menu without
          choosing a command, click on
          the menu name a second time
          or click anywhere outside
          the menu.

          2) Drag down from the menu
          name to highlight the
          required command, then
          release the mouse button. To
          close the menu without
          choosing a command, simply
          drag off the menu (so that
          no command is highlighted)
          then release the mouse
          button.

          Note: While a menu command
          is highlighted, a brief
          description of that command
          is given on the Status Bar.

C14       Command Notes:
          1) Commands that have an
          ellipsis (...) after them
          signify that further
          information must be supplied
          in order for the command to
          be carried out.
          2) Dimmed commands are
          unavailable at that time.
          3) Commands that have a
          check mark (Ä) to the left
          of them signify that the
          command is in effect.
          Selecting the command again
          removes the check mark and
          turns the command off.
          4) Some commands have key
          combinations to the right of
          them. At any time, pressing
          the listed keys selects the
          command without having to
          open the menu. See:

          containing a single, blank
          image (100x100). The colour
          palette is also reset to the
          standard palette.

          You will be prompted to save
          the current image file if it
          has been altered since it
          was last saved.

C14       Open...
C12       menu command

          Selecting this command
          allows an existing image
          file to be loaded into the
          Image Editor, from disk. If
          the image file being opened
          uses a non-standard colour
          palette, it's associated
          palette file is also
          automatically loaded.

          The "Open Image File" dialog
          box is displayed containing
          a "File" input box, at the
          top, and a file list box
          below it. Use these to
          specify a file to open, as
          described below.

          Type a file name into the
          "File" input box and then
          press ENTER. If no file name
          extension is specified, the
          default for image files
          (.PUT) is assumed.
          Alternatively, a file mask
          can be entered in order to
          list a specific group of
          files in the file list box.
          The default mask (*.PUT) is
          used initially to list all
          files with a .PUT extension.

          Simply double-clicking on a
          file name listed in the file
          list box is usually the
          easiest way to specify a
          file to open. Alternatively,
          highlight a listed file name
          by clicking on it, then
          click on the OK button.

          You can use the scroll bar
          provided to look through a
          list of files that's too
          long to display on a single
          "page".

C14       Append...
C12       menu command

          Allows the images contained
          in another file to be added
          to the end of the current
          file. Note that the images
          are only copied to the
          current file - the file
          being appended remains
          unaltered.

          The "Append Image File"
          dialog box is displayed so
          that a file can be
          specified. The usual "File"
          input box and file list box
          are shown and are
          functionally identical to
          those used by the Open...
          command. For full details
          on how to use them, see:
C13H009     Open...

          Note: If the images in the
          appended file were created
          using a different colour
          palette to that of the
          current image file, they may
          appear incorrectly coloured
          as it is assumed both files
          use a common palette. The
          current colour palette is
          always retained when
          appending an image file.

C12       menu command

          Use this command to write
          the current image file to
          disk, effectively updating
          it with any changes made
          since it was last saved. The
          colour palette is also saved
          (in a separate file) if it
          differs from the standard
          palette.

          If the current file has not
          been saved before, and so is
          "untitled", you will be
          asked to specify a name to
          save the file under, just as
          if you had selected the Save
          As... command.

          Tip: If you want to write a
          file to disk without
          overwriting the original
          version, you should save it
          under a different name by

C12       menu command

          Allows the current image
          file to be written to disk
          under a new name, thus
          keeping the original file
          unaltered. The colour
          palette is also saved (in a
          separate file) if it differs
          from the standard palette.

          The "Save Image File As"
          dialog box is displayed
          containing a single "File
          Name" input box; simply type
          the new file name here, then
          press ENTER. If no file name
          extension is specified, the
          default for image files

          ready for use by the various
          tools and commands that use
          the Clipboard image.

          The "Load Clipboard" dialog
          box is displayed so that a
          file can be specified. The
          usual "File" input box and
          file list box are shown and
          are functionally identical
          to those used by the Open...

          box. This feature can be
          disabled by unchecking the
          "Preview image" option.
          Doing so can speed up the
          use of the file list box on
          slower computer systems.

          Note: Clipboard images that
          were created using a
          different colour palette to
          the current one, may appear
          incorrectly coloured.

          To remove an unwanted
          Clipboard image file from
          disk, highlight it in the
          file list box and then click
          on the DELETE button. You
          will be asked to confirm
          your decision before the
          image is actually deleted.

          The "Load Palette" dialog
          box is displayed so that a
          file can be specified. The
          usual "File" input box and
          file list box are shown and
          are functionally identical

C12       menu command

          If you have a printer
          connected to your system (on
          LPT1:), you can use this
          command to print out the
          current image file's image
          index - this is a list of
          BASIC array subscripts
          specifying where each image
          is stored. These values are
          needed in order to display
          any given image when using
          the PUT(graphics) statement
          in your own BASIC programs.
          For further details, consult
          the PIXELplus 256 User's
          Manual.

          The "Print Index" dialog box
          is displayed so that the
          required index listing can
          be detailed.

C14       Print Range:
          Check the "Whole File"
          option to have an index
          printed for all the images
          in the current image file.

          Checking the "Select Range"
          option allows you to specify
          a contiguous range of images
          to print an index for. The
          "First" input box is
          activated so that the
          initial image of the range
          can be specified. Using only
          this input box would print
          an index for that one
          specified image. However,
          using the "Last" input box
          lets you specify the final
          image of the range.

          The image denoted by the
          currently active input box
          is displayed in the preview
          box, giving visual
          confirmation that the
          intended image has been
          selected.

C14       Print Format:
          With the "Double Spacing"
          option checked, a blank line
          will be placed between the
          index items on the printout.
          This simply gives more room
          to write in comments/
          descriptions and makes the
          listing easier to read, but
          uses more paper.

C14       Undo
C12       menu command

          Using the Undo command
          removes the latest edit made
          to the current image,
          allowing mistakes to be
          corrected.

          Note that using Undo to
          remove a mistake made while
          using a Drawing Tool will
          remove ALL the changes made
          since the tool was selected.
          However, making use of the
          STORE button allows you to
          update the "Undo Image" at
          any time. See:
C13H104     STORE Button

          Tip: You can use the Undo
          Eraser to selectively remove
          areas of a tool's effect.
          However, changes made with
          the Undo Eraser cannot
          themselves be undone. See:
C13H088     Undo Eraser

          Tip: Using Undo repeatedly
          lets you switch between both
          the edited and unedited
          version of an image - a
          useful way of deciding
          whether to keep the changes
          made by a special effect
          etc.

          Note: Unlike Edit and Action
          menu commands, the effects
          of using Image menu commands
          cannot be reversed by using
          Undo.

C12       menu command

          Simply places a copy of the
          Edit Grid image section onto
          the Clipboard.

          Tip: To copy an area of
          image with more accuracy,
          use the Scissors tool. See:

C14       Paste
C12       menu command

          Places the Clipboard image
          onto the Edit Grid image
          section.

          Note that the top, left of
          the Clipboard image will be
          located to the top, left of
          the Edit Grid. Thus, a
          Clipboard image that's wider
          and/or deeper than the Edit
          Grid will be cropped along
          the right and/or bottom
          edges. This makes the Paste
          command more useful when
          copying one image to another
          of the same size.

          Tip: To paste with more
          accuracy, use the Paste
          Brush tool. See:
C13H066     Paste Brush

          Note: The current settings
          of the Transparency On and

          image will be applied to the

          replaced with the

C14       Cross-hair On
C12       menu command

          Enable this command to have
          a cross-hair cursor
          displayed while pointing on
          the Edit Grid: a horizontal
          and vertical line span the
          Edit Grid, intersecting at
          the centre of the cursor.
          This is a useful aid for
          aligning objects etc.

          Tip: The cross-hair cursor
          is particularly useful when
          trying to accurately cut or
          copy an area of image using
          the Scissors tool. See:

C14       Grid On
C12       menu command

          When this command is in
          effect, a pixel boundary
          grid is displayed on the
          Edit Grid. Each pixel is
          then instantly
          distinguishable from the
          pixels that surround it.

          As a further aid, the actual
          colour of the grid can be
          set to black, dark grey,
          light grey or white: press
          SHIFT+F4 repeatedly to cycle
          through the four available
          colours.

          Tip: The pixel boundary grid
          can be particularly useful
          when doing close-up,
          detailed work with the Pixel
          Pointer tool. See:
C13H086     Pixel Pointer

          Note: The pixel boundary
          grid is not displayed when
          the Edit Grid is at 1x
          (actual size) zoom
          magnification.

          instead of the usual single
          copy. This is useful when
          creating images to be used
          as tiles - especially when
          you want the tile to appear
          seamless.

          colour, it is made the
          Current Colour.

          Note: Repeated use of this

          specified size, to the

          The "Add Image(s)" dialog
          box is displayed so that the
          required image(s) can be
          detailed.

          Specify the size for the new
          image(s) by setting the
          "Width" and "Depth" values.
          An example image is
          displayed in the preview
          box, on the right side of
          the dialog box, to show the

          There are three values
          displayed at the bottom of
          the dialog box which give
          useful status information:

          of bytes needed to create
          the new image(s), using the
          current settings.

          "Space" shows the total
          number of free bytes
          currently available for
          images.

          "Result" shows the total
          number of bytes that will be
          available for images after
          creating the new image(s),

C14       Delete...
C12       menu command

          Use this command to remove
          one or more unwanted images
          from the current image file.

          Note: Be careful when using
          this command as deleted
          images cannot be retrieved
          by using the Edit/Undo
          command. It's a good idea to
          save the current image file
          before attempting any
          significant deletion.

          The "Delete Image(s)" dialog
          box is displayed so that you
          can specify the image(s) you
          want deleted.

          If you want to delete one
          image only, simply set
          "First" to the image you
          want to delete. When
          deleting two or more
          contiguous images, set
          "First" to the initial image
          of the range you want
          deleted.

          The "Last" input box is
          initially dimmed (inactive)
          and should only be activated
          and used when you want to
          delete two or more
          contiguous images, in which
          case, set it to the final
          image of the range to be
          deleted.

          The image denoted by the
          currently active input box
          is displayed in the preview
          box, giving visual
          confirmation that the
          intended image has been
          selected.

          Note: You can't delete every
          image in the current image
          file. At least one image
          must remain defined.

          There are four values
          displayed at the bottom of
          the dialog box which give
          useful status information:

          "Count" shows the total
          number of images that will
          be deleted, using the
          current settings.

          "Reclaims" shows the number
          of bytes that will be made
          available for images by
          deleting the specified
          image(s).

          image to be reduced or
          increased.

          Note: Be careful when using

          of resizing an image cannot
          be reversed by using the
          Edit/Undo command. It's a
          good idea to save the
          current image file before
          attempting any significant
          resizing operation.

          The "Resize Image" dialog
          box is displayed so that the
          image and it's new size can
          be specified.

          Set "Image" to the image you
          want to resize. The selected
          image is displayed in the
          preview box, on the right of
          the dialog box, giving
          visual confirmation that the
          correct image has been
          selected.

          Specify the new size for the
          image by setting the "Width"
          and "Depth" values. An
          example of what the image
          will look like is displayed
          to ensure it is resized
          correctly.

          There are four values

          "Original" shows the current
          size of the selected image.

          "Requires" shows the number
          of bytes needed to resize
          the specified image, using
          the current settings. A
          negative value here
          indicates bytes reclaimed.

          "Space" shows the total
          number of free bytes
          currently available for
          images.

          "Result" shows the total

C14       Convert to Mask...
C12       menu command

          This command allows existing
          images to be converted to
          their equivalent masks: a
          special type of image
          required for displaying
          images over existing screen
          objects so that only the
          image's exact shape is
          displayed, allowing
          background objects to still
          be visible around it.

          This is an advanced
          technique which is discussed
          fully in the PIXELplus 256
          User's Manual.

          Note: Be careful when using
          this command as the effect
          of converting an image
          cannot be reversed by using
          the Edit/Undo command. It's
          a good idea to save the
          current image file before
          attempting any significant
          conversion to masks.

          The "Convert to Mask" dialog
          box is displayed so that the
          required image conversion
          can be detailed.

C14       Mask Type:
          Check the "Exact Mask"
          option to have the specified
          images converted to masks
          that correspond to their
          exact shape.

          Check the "Expanded Mask"
          option to have the specified
          images converted to expanded
          masks. Images displayed
          using this type of mask will
          have a black outline (one
          pixel thick) around them
          which helps to distinguish
          them from the background
          screen image. The mouse
          pointer uses this technique
          so that the white arrow is
          always visible, even when
          placed over an all-white
          area of screen.

          Note: Any image to be
          converted to an expanded
          mask must be of sufficient
          size to hold the enlarged
          mask shape - making sure the
          actual image shape doesn't
          touch any edge of the image
          will ensure there's enough
          room.

C14       Conversion Range:
          Check the "Whole File"
          option to have all the
          images in the current image
          file converted to their mask
          equivalents. When doing so,
          it is assumed you intend to
          maintain two separate files:
          one containing the actual
          images and another
          containing the corresponding
          mask images. As such, you
          will be prompted to save the
          current image file before
          the images are converted, if
          it has altered since it was
          last saved.

          Note: After the images have
          been converted, it's
          important to remember to
          save the current image file
          (which now contains the
          masks) by choosing File/Save
          As..., and specify a
          different name. DO NOT
          select File/Save as this
          will overwrite the original
          image file.

          To clarify the whole
          process, consider this
          example: if you create an
          image file and save it as
          SPRITES.PUT, then convert
          the whole file to mask
          images and save it as
          SPRITES.MSK; you will now
          have two files: SPRITES.PUT
          containing the actual images
          and SPRITES.MSK containing
          the mask images.

          Checking the "Select Range"
          option allows you to specify
          a single image or a
          contiguous range of images
          to convert to masks. The
          "First" input box is
          activated so that the
          initial image of the range
          can be specified. Using only
          this input box lets you
          convert that one specified
          image. However, using the
          "Last" input box lets you
          specify the final image of
          the range.

          The image denoted by the
          currently active input box
          is displayed in the preview
          box, giving visual
          confirmation that the
          intended image has been
          selected.

          section is retained (the
          portion of image currently
          visible on the Edit Grid).
          Everything outside the Edit
          Grid is discarded.

          You will be asked to confirm
          your decision before the

C14       Add as Gradient
C12       menu command

          An advanced feature of the
          PIXELplus 256 Image Editor
          is the ability to design
          your own gradient styles -
          used by the various Drawing
          Tools that work using a
          colour gradient (Gradient
          Fill etc.) This is achieved
          by first designing the
          gradient style and then
          selecting this command to
          have it added to the user-
          defined group of gradient
          styles, which can be
          accessed by clicking on the
          Gradient Status Box. See:
C13H100     Gradient Status Box

          The current image must
          conform to the following
          requirements in order for it
          to be used as a valid user-
          defined gradient style:
          1) It must be a full-size
          (100x100) image.
          in size.
          2) All eight colours, from 0
          to 7, must be used in the
          design of the gradient
          style. Colours 0 and 7
          should be used to represent
          what will be the Current
          Colour and Secondary Colour
          while colours 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
          and 6 represent the
          intermediate colours used in
          the gradient.
          3) No others colours may be
          used in the design of the
          gradient style.

          As a demonstration, open the
          file DEMOGRAD.PUT to see how
          a gradient style should be
          designed. You can then
          select Add as Gradient to
          have it added to the user-
          defined group of gradient
          styles. You could also
          produce a dithered version
          of the gradient style by
          applying several layers of
          the MIX or FUR special
          effect - depending on how
          severe you want the
          dithering. Evenly applying
          MIX, using the Special
          Effects Brush, generally
          produces the most effective
          results.

C14       Status Bar

          This is a single line of
          text (running along the
          bottom of the screen) used
          to show relevant information
          such as available keyboard
          commands, mouse button
          functions, Drawing Tool set
          up information, menu command
          descriptions etc.

          Due to the limited space for
          displaying information on
          the Status Bar, two special
          symbols are used to denote
          the function of the mouse
          buttons:

          Ñ means click the LEFT mouse
          button.

          Ö means click the RIGHT
          mouse button.

          For example, "ÖSample" on
          the Status Bar informs you
          that clicking the right
          mouse button will sample a
          colour, when pointing on the
          Edit Grid.

          This block of eight icon
          buttons will be displayed at
          the top, left of the screen,
          except when the Palette
          Tools have been selected in
          which case they are replaced
          with the Palette Tool
          buttons. See:
C13H110     Palette Tool Buttons

          Note: Although there's only
          enough room on-screen to
          display eight Drawing Tool
          icon buttons at a time,
          there are in fact eighteen
          different tools available:

          If the required tool button
          isn't currently visible,
          left-click repeatedly on the
          appropriate button to cycle
          through any related tools
          available on that button
          position. For example,
          successive clicks on the
          Paintbrush button will
          reveal and select the Pixel
          Pointer tool, then the
          Airbrush tool and finally
          return to the Paintbrush

C14       Tool Set Up
          As a further enhancement,
          some of the Drawing Tools
          can be set up to function in
          a particular way; for
          example, the Eraser can be
          set up to function as a
          Normal Eraser, a Colour
          Eraser or an Undo Eraser.

          Tip: If you're unsure how
          the current Drawing Tool has
          been set up, simply point on
          the Edit Grid and the
          function of the current
          Drawing Tool will be
          displayed on the Status Bar.

C14       Changing a Tool's Set Up
          By right-clicking on a
          Drawing Tool icon button, a
          "Set Up" dialog box is
          displayed (if that tool has
          set up options) where
          various set up options can
          be set. The options
          available will depend on the
          tool being set up - full
          details are included in each
          tool's Help section.

          Note: Any alterations made
          to a tool's set up remain in
          effect until explicitly
          changed. This is true even
          when restarting the Image
          Editor as all tool set up
          information (among other
          things) is maintained in the
          file PP256_ED.SET.

C14       Useful Things to Remember
          When using certain Drawing
          Tools that require an object
          to be positioned and/or
          sized (Paste Brush, Line
          etc.), it's possible to view
          the object either as a
          simple outline, or as a true
          view which shows exactly
          what will be produced by the
          tool. You can toggle between
          outline and true view by
          pressing SPACE, while
          pointing on the Edit Grid -
          even when in the middle of
          using a tool. Using the true
          view can be very useful when
          trying to use a tool with
          absolute accuracy.

          Note: You may have to stick
          with using the outline view
          if you are using a slower
          computer system.

          Many of the Drawing Tools -
          such as Line, Scissors etc.
          - involve setting the size
          of an object before the
          final effect of the tool is
          produced. When using such a
          tool, keep the following
          points in mind:
          1) The object's size is
          displayed above the Edit
          Grid.
          2) The object's origin can
          be moved by using the arrow
          keys.
          3) Right-click or press
          ESCAPE to cancel the
          operation.

C14       Scissors
C12       drawing tool

          The main use of this tool is
          to allow a rectangular area
          of image to be moved from
          one place to another (cut
          then pasted). However, it
          can also be used to set the
          exact size and position of
          the Edit Grid, delete
          (clear) a section of image,
          or to copy a specific area
          of image onto the Clipboard.

C14       Set Up Options
          Right-click on the Scissors
          icon button to change the
          Scissors set up.

          The "Set Up: SCISSORS"
          dialog box is displayed.
          From here, altering either
          the "Transparency On" or
          "Paste Behind" options has
          exactly the same effect as
          using the Edit menu commands
          of the same name and are
          included here for
          convenience. See:
C13H024     Transparency On
C13H025     Paste Behind

C14       How to Use
          Depending on which function
          you want to perform, the
          Scissors tool must be used
          in two or three steps:

C14       Step One
          Select a rectangular area of
          image by clicking on one
          corner (the origin) and then
          move the mouse to the
          opposite corner.

          Tip: It's sometimes easier
          to accurately select an area
          with the cross-hair cursor
          on: check the View/Cross-
          hair On command. See:
C13H028     Cross-hair On

C14       Step Two
          Click to cut the selected
          area of image onto the
          Clipboard. Alternatively,
          the following keyboard
          commands are now available:

          C - Copy area to Clipboard.
          D - Delete area.
          G - Set Edit Grid to area.

          Note: A reminder of
          available keyboard commands
          is displayed on the Status
          Bar.

C14       Step Three
          If you have chosen to cut or
          copy the selected image
          section onto the Clipboard,
          this is immediately made
          available to paste at a new
          position: using the mouse,
          position it as required then
          click to paste it there.

C14       Paste Brush
C12       drawing tool

          This tool enables you to
          apply (paste) the Clipboard
          image onto the current
          image - in a number of
          different ways. The way the
          Clipboard image is pasted
          will depend on how the Paste
          Brush tool has been set up
          to function.

          The current Clipboard image
          is shown on the Clipboard
          Status Box which can be used
          to perform various Clipboard
          related operations. See:
C13H101     Clipboard Status Box

C14       Set Up Options
          Right-click on the Paste
          Brush icon button to change
          the Paste Brush set up.

          The "Set Up: PASTE BRUSH"
          dialog box is displayed.
          From here, you can specify
          how you want the Paste Brush
          tool to function.

          Check the "Rubber Stamp"
          function to use the Paste
          Brush tool for accurately
          pasting copies of the
          Clipboard image.

          Check the "Resize" function
          to use the Paste Brush tool
          for pasting resized copies
          of the Clipboard image.

          The "Horizontal Skew"
          function allows you to slant
          the Clipboard image
          horizontally before pasting.

          The "Vertical Skew" function
          allows you to slant the
          Clipboard image vertically
          before pasting.

          Altering either the
          "Transparency On" or "Paste
          Behind" options has exactly
          the same effect as using the
          Edit menu commands of the
          same name and are included
          here for convenience. See:
C13H024     Transparency On
C13H025     Paste Behind

C14       How to Use
          The way the Paste Brush tool
          must be used depends on how
          it has been set up to
          function. The four modes of
          operation are detailed in
          turn below.

C14       Rubber Stamp
          Simply position the image
          cursor and click to paste.
          Drag the image cursor to use
          the Clipboard image as a
          brush for drawing.

C14       Resize
          Click on one corner (the
          origin) then move the mouse
          to the opposite corner
          before clicking a second
          time to paste a resized copy
          of the Clipboard image.

C14       Horizontal Skew
          Position the top edge of the
          image cursor then click.
          Move the mouse left or right
          to set the required amount
          of horizontal skew, then
          click to paste.

C14       Vertical Skew
          Position the left edge of
          the image cursor then click.
          Move the mouse up or down to
          set the required amount of
          vertical skew, then click to
          paste.

C14       Special Effects Brush
C12       drawing tool

          The PIXELplus 256 Image
          Editor provides fourteen
          powerful special effects
          that can be applied to
          images, or selected areas of
          image, to alter their
          appearance in specific ways.

          Special Effects:
C13H068     BRIGHT (variable)
C13H069     DARK (variable)
C13H070     TINT (variable)
C13H071     FUR (variable)
C13H072     MIX (variable)
C13H073     SOFT
C13H074     UNZAG
C13H075     HOLLOW
C13H076     TILE
C13H077     XOR
C13H078     GREY
C13H079     SWEEP
C13H080     SWAP
C13H081     EDGE

          The Special Effects Brush
          allows the current special
          effect to be accurately
          applied to specific areas of
          image.

          The name of the current
          special effect is displayed
          on the Brush Size Selector
          box. To change the brush
          size, see:
C13H098     Brush Size Selector

          Note: The Special Effects
          Brush is only available in a
          square brush shape,
          regardless of the currently
          selected brush shape.

C14       How to Use
          Click to apply the current
          special effect to the area
          of image at the brush
          cursor, or drag to
          continuously apply the
          effect.

          Note: A new layer of special
          effect is applied each time
          the left mouse button is
          pressed. Ensure the whole
          area you want to affect is
          visible on the Edit Grid
          when you want to apply an
          even layer of special
          effect.

C14       Selecting a Special Effect
          Employ one of the following
          methods to select a new
          special effect to use:

          1) Click on the Brush Size
          Selector box to reveal a
          menu, then click on the
          required special effect
          name. To close the menu
          without choosing a new
          special effect, click on the
          highlighted current special
          effect name (at the top of
          the menu) or click anywhere
          outside the menu.

          2) Drag down from the Brush
          Size Selector box to
          highlight the required
          special effect name, then
          release the mouse button. To
          close the menu without
          choosing a new special
          effect, simply drag off the
          menu (so that no effect is
          highlighted) then release
          the mouse button.

          Note: While a special effect
          name is highlighted, a brief
          description of that effect
          is given on the Status Bar.

C14       Variable Special Effects
          Five of the special effects
          are variable which means
          they have an individual
          "Strength" setting that
          dictates how severely the
          effect will work. The
          variable special effects are
          BRIGHT, DARK, TINT, FUR and
          MIX.

C14       Changing the Strength
C14       of an Effect
          Right-click on the Brush
          Size Selector box to display
          the "Effect Strength" dialog
          box where you can specify
          the current special effect's
          "Strength" directly. Valid
          settings range from 1 (weak)
          to 100 (strong).

          Note: Any alterations made
          to a special effect's
          "Strength" setting remain in
          effect until explicitly
          changed. This is true even
          when restarting the Image
          Editor as special effect
          "Strength" settings (among
          other things) are maintained
          in the file PP256_ED.SET.

C14       Palette-dependent Effects
          Some of the special effects
          are palette-dependent,
          meaning that they rely
          heavily on the colours
          available in the current
          palette in order to produce
          the desired effect; for
          example, using the GREY
          special effect with a
          palette that contains few
          shades of grey will be
          unlikely to produce
          satisfactory results. The
          palette-dependent effects
          are BRIGHT, DARK, TINT,
          SOFT, UNZAG and GREY.

          See the PIXELplus 256 User's
          Manual for details on

C14       BRIGHT
C12       special effect

          The BRIGHT special effect
          can be used to increase the
          perceived brightness of
          affected areas of image by
          converting coloured pixels
          to ones of a brighter shade.
          Black areas of image are not
          affected because it is
          usually desirable to
          brighten actual image
          objects only, and not the
          background, which is
          normally black.

          The current "Strength"
          setting of the BRIGHT
          special effect dictates the
          severity of the effect
          produced.

C14       SOFT
C12       special effect

          SOFT is a powerful special
          effect that uses a technique
          known as "anti-aliasing" to
          give all edges of image
          objects a softer, slightly
          blurred appearance. When
          used correctly, SOFT can
          greatly improve the
          appearance of images, giving
          them an almost digitized
          look. Use repeatedly to
          achieve a blurred, out of
          focus look.

          SOFT uses total anti-
          aliasing. For a milder form
          of anti-aliasing, see:
C13H074     UNZAG

C14       XOR
C12       special effect

          Applying the XOR special
          effect to an area of image
          changes the colour of
          affected pixels by
          performing a logical XOR
          (exclusive OR) between them
          and the Current Colour. See:
C13H099     Selected Colour Boxes

          Note: It's not the actual
          colour of pixels (the RGB
          values) but the colour
          number (attribute) of pixels
          that XOR operates on.

          Although using the XOR
          special effect can produce
          some unpredictable results
          (especially when applied to
          multicoloured areas of
          image), experimentation can
          achieve some interesting
          results.

          Tip: Using XOR on an area of
          image that was drawn using
          the Current Colour will
          invert the image.

          tiling to be oriented to the
          top, left corner of the

          The Airbrush continuously
          applies colour at the small,
          cross-hair cursor position
          while the left mouse button
          is held down. Consequently,
          the speed at which you drag
          the cursor will dictate the
          density of the colour
          sprayed.

C14       Eraser
C12       drawing tool

          This tool allows unwanted
          areas of image to be
          accurately removed. The
          actual parts of an image
          that will be erased depends
          on how the Eraser tool has
          been set up to function.

          To change the brush size,
          see:
C13H098     Brush Size Selector

          Note: The Eraser is only
          available in a square brush
          shape, regardless of the
          currently selected brush
          shape.

C14       Set Up Options
          Right-click on the Eraser
          icon button to change the
          Eraser tool set up.

          The "Set Up: ERASER" dialog
          box is displayed. From here,
          you can specify how you want
          the Eraser tool to function.

          Check the "Normal Eraser"
          function to have the Eraser
          tool remove all parts of an
          image that it's applied to.

          Checking the "Colour Eraser"
          function will cause the
          Eraser tool to only remove
          areas of image that match
          the Current Colour, as
          indicated on the Selected
          Colour Boxes. See:

          Checking the "Undo Eraser"
          function allows the Eraser
          tool to be used to
          selectively remove the
          effects of the latest edit.
          For example, if while
          drawing a freehand line you
          accidentally slip, you can
          use the Undo Eraser to
          remove the mistake without
          erasing the whole line,
          which is what the Edit/Undo
          command would do. See:
C13H020     Undo

          Note: Because of the way the
          Undo Eraser works, changes
          made to an image with it
          cannot themselves be undone.

C14       How to Use
          Click to apply the Eraser at
          the brush cursor position,
          or drag to continuously
          apply the Eraser.

C14       Circle/Ellipse
C12       drawing tool

          Using this tool allows a
          circle or ellipse to be
          drawn onto the current
          image.

          The colour used to draw the
          circle/ellipse will be the
          Current Colour, as indicated
          on the Selected Colour
          Boxes. See:
C13H099     Selected Colour Boxes

          The circle/ellipse will be

          brush shape, size and
          strength. To change any of
          these, see:
C13H098     Brush Size Selector

C14       How to Use
          The Circle/Ellipse tool is
          used by specifying a
          rectangular area into which
          the shape will be inscribed.

          First, define the
          rectangular area of image by
          clicking on one corner (the
          origin) and then move the
          mouse to the opposite
          corner. Next, click a second
          time to draw the circle/
          ellipse inside the specified

          solid circle or ellipse to
          be drawn onto the current
          image.

          The colour used to draw the
          actual circle/ellipse will
          be the Current Colour, as
          indicated on the Selected
          Colour Boxes. See:
C13H099     Selected Colour Boxes
          However, the colour used to
          fill the shape depends on
          how the Filled Circle/
          Ellipse tool has been set up
          to function.

          The actual circle/ellipse
          will be drawn using the
          current brush shape, size
          and strength. To change any
          of these, see:
C13H098     Brush Size Selector

          Right-click on the Filled
          Circle/Ellipse icon button
          to change the Filled Circle/
          Ellipse tool set up.

          The "Set Up: FILLED CIRCLE/
          ELLIPSE" dialog box is
          displayed. From here, you
          can specify how you want the
          Filled Circle/Ellipse tool
          to function.

          Check the "Use Two Colours"
          option to have the Filled
          Circle/Ellipse tool draw
          circles and ellipses using
          two colours: the Current
          Colour will be used to draw
          the actual circle/ellipse
          and the Secondary Colour
          will be used to fill the
          shape.

          If the "Use Two Colours"
          option is left unchecked
          then the Current Colour will
          be used to both draw the
          actual circle/ellipse and to
          fill it.

          Note: Both the Filled
          Circle/Ellipse and Filled
          Box tools share the same
          "Use Two Colours" set up

C14       Colour Sampler
C12       drawing tool

          This useful tool allows you
          to select colours directly
          from the current image (via
          the Edit Grid) instead of
          having to select them from
          the Palette Grid every time.
          This not only saves time, it
          also ensures that you select
          the correct colour when the
          current palette contains
          several similar shades.

C14       How to Use
          The Colour Sampler is such a
          useful and often-used tool
          that it is always available
          (regardless of the currently
          selected Drawing Tool) and
          can be employed by using the
          right mouse button: right-
          click to select the colour
          at the current cursor
          position, or drag the small,
          cross-hair cursor to point
          at the desired colour. The
          sampled colour is then made
          the Current Colour. See:
C13H099     Selected Colour Boxes

          Tip: You can tell at a
          glance which colour the
          Colour Sampler will select
          as the colour being pointed
          at will be highlighted on
          the Palette Grid.

          is sprayed when using the
          Airbrush.

          The "Spray Strength" dialog
          box is displayed so that the
          "Strength" can be specified
          directly. Valid settings
          range from 1 (slow) to 100
          (fast).

          Note: Any alteration made to
          the spray "Strength" setting
          will remain in effect until
          explicitly changed. This is
          true even when restarting
          the Image Editor as the

          Tip: Set the brush
          "Strength" to a value less

C14       Selected Colour Boxes

          When required, a pair of
          colour selection boxes are
          displayed on the left of the
          screen, above the Palette
          Grid. They show the two
          currently selected colours
          along with their associated
          colour number (known as the
          attribute number).

          The box with the arrow
          pointing to it - which can
          be either box - holds the
          Current Colour; the other
          box holds the Secondary
          Colour. The Current Colour
          is used by tools and
          commands that work with one
          colour while the Secondary
          Colour is needed for tools
          that operate using two
          colours (Gradient Fill, SWAP
          special effect etc.).

          You can swap the priority of
          the two selected colours by
          left-clicking on the
          Secondary Colour box: the
          Secondary Colour becomes the
          Current Colour and vice-
          versa.

          Tip: Press TAB to swap the
          priority of the two selected
          colours, on-the-fly.

          Tip: Right-click on either
          of the Selected Colour Boxes
          to quickly change between
          the Drawing Tools and the

C14       Gradient Status Box

          Located on the left of the
          screen, below the Drawing
          Tool icon buttons, this
          object is displayed for
          tools that use a colour
          gradient. It shows the
          current gradient style with
          colours that blend from the
          Current Colour into the
          Secondary Colour.

          Tip: If the colours blend in
          the wrong direction (e.g.
          red to black instead of
          black to red), simply click
          on the Secondary Colour box
          (or press TAB) to swap the
          priority of the two selected
          colours. See:
C13H099     Selected Colour Boxes

          The value displayed to the
          right indicates the number
          of colours that will be used
          in the gradient (maximum of
          8). Generally speaking, the
          greater the number of
          colours used in the
          gradient, the "smoother" the
          transition between the two
          selected colours will be.

          Click on the Gradient Status
          Box to choose a different
          gradient style.

          The "Gradient Styles" dialog
          box is displayed so that a
          gradient style can be
          selected.

          Check the "Standard" option
          to select a gradient style
          from the group of 32
          standard styles that
          comprise 16 normal and 16
          dithered styles.

          Checking the "User-defined"
          option allows a gradient
          style to be selected from
          any that have been created
          using the Image/Add as
          Gradient command. See:
C13H055     Add as Gradient

          Unwanted user-defined
          gradient styles can be
          removed by clicking on the
          DELETE button. You will be
          asked to confirm your
          decision before the style is
          actually deleted.

          Click on the "Select" arrow
          buttons to view the
          available gradient styles in
          the preview box, then click
          the OK button, or press
          ENTER, to select the
          displayed style.

C14       Clipboard Status Box

          The Clipboard Status Box is
          made available to all tools
          that use the Clipboard image
          (except the TILE Special

          on the left of the screen,
          directly below the Drawing
          Tool icon buttons.

          The left side shows the
          current Clipboard image
          which will be a scaled down
          version if it's too big to
          be displayed at full size.

          Tip: Left-clicking on the
          Clipboard image is a quick
          way to access the "Load
          Clipboard" dialog box. See:

          On the right are three
          action buttons. Clicking on
          these will perform the
          indicated action on the
          Clipboard image. They are:

          FLIP-H - Flips the Clipboard
          image horizontally.
          FLIP-V - Flips the Clipboard
          image vertically.
          ROTATE - Turns the Clipboard
          image clockwise through 90Å.

C14       Palette Grid

          The Palette Grid is located
          at the bottom, left of the
          screen. This 16x16 grid
          shows the complete set
          (palette) of 256 available
          colours.

          The Palette Grid is mainly
          used for selecting colours
          to use with Drawing Tools
          etc: left-click or right-
          click on a colour to select
          it and make it the Current
          Colour. This is then placed
          in one of the two Selected
          Colour Boxes (if visible),
          depending on which mouse
          button you click with -
          left-click to put the colour
          into the top box; right-
          click to put the colour into
          the bottom box. See:
C13H099     Selected Colour Boxes

          The Current Colour is
          highlighted on the Palette
          Grid, except when pointing
          on the Edit Grid in which
          case the colour of the pixel
          being pointed at is
          highlighted. You can also
          drag the highlight to select
          a colour from the Palette
          Grid.

          Notice that pointing on the
          Palette Grid changes the
          mouse cursor to show the
          colour number (attribute)
          being pointed at (0 to 255).

C14       Edit Grid

          The Edit Grid is the area
          where all the main image
          editing is done and,
          consequently, is situated in
          the centre of the screen.
          This is where all the
          various Drawing Tools are
          used to directly edit the
          current image. See:
C13H064     Drawing Tool Icon Buttons

          The Edit Grid can be thought
          of as a window onto the
          current image that can be
          set to various degrees of
          magnification, making the
          detailed and accurate
          editing of images much
          easier. See:
C13H105     Zoom Buttons

          The current size of the Edit
          Grid is displayed directly
          above it, except when using
          a Drawing Tool that involves
          setting the size of an
          object (Line, Scissors etc.)
          in which case the size of
          the object is displayed.

          Notice that by just pointing
          on the Edit Grid, two things
          happen:
          1) The position coordinates
          of the mouse cursor are
          displayed on the panel below
          the Edit Grid. Two sets of
          coordinates are shown:
          "Grid" coordinates show the
          current position of the
          cursor relative to the top,
          left corner of the Edit
          Grid; "Image" coordinates
          show the current position of
          the cursor relative to the
          top, left corner of the
          current image.
          2) The colour of the pixel
          at the current mouse cursor
          position is highlighted on
          the Palette Grid, allowing
          you to tell at a glance
          exactly what colour any
          given image pixel is. The
          highlighted colour can be
          made the Current Colour by
          clicking the right mouse
          button. See:
C13H097     Colour Sampler

C14       Using with the Palette Tools
          When the Palette Tools
          are selected, the function
          of the Edit Grid changes to
          allow colours to be selected
          in the same way as using the
          Palette Grid: left-click or
          right-click on a pixel to
          make it's colour the Current
          Colour. This is then placed
          in one of the two Selected
          Colour Boxes, depending on
          which button you click with
          - left-click to put the
          colour into the top box;
          right-click to put the
          colour into the bottom box.
          See:

C13H099     Selected Colour Boxes

          Notice that pointing on the
          Edit Grid changes the mouse
          cursor to show the colour
          number (attribute) of the
          pixel being pointed at (0 to
          255).

C14       STORE Button

          This button is situated in
          the centre section of the
          screen, above the right side
          of the Edit Grid. It's
          specialized function is
          related directly to the
          Edit/Undo command. See:
C13H020     Undo

          Using Edit/Undo to remove a
          mistake made while using a
          Drawing Tool will remove ALL
          the changes made since the
          tool was selected. This
          isn't always desirable.
          Clicking the STORE button,
          after making any changes
          that you're sure you want to
          keep, will effectively store
          a copy of the current image
          (known as the "Undo Image").
          Thus, any subsequent use of
          Edit/Undo will return the
          current image to the exact
          state it was when the STORE
          button was clicked. You can
          click the STORE button at
          any time to update the "Undo
          Image".

          Tip: Click the STORE button
          immediately before
          attempting to use a Drawing
          Tool to do a fiddly or
          experimental alteration to
          the current image. You can
          then simply select Edit/
          Undo, should the alteration
          be undesirable.

C14       Zoom Buttons

          This row of six buttons are
          located in the centre screen
          area, directly below the
          Edit Grid. Comprising five
          pre-set Zoom and a Maximize
          button, they are used to
          directly set the Edit Grid
          magnification level.

          Click on one of the pre-set
          Zoom buttons to change the
          Edit Grid magnification to
          the level shown on the
          button. Using a higher zoom
          level generally makes doing
          detailed, accurate work much
          easier.

          The Maximize (blue triangle)
          button has two functions,
          depending on which button
          you click on it with: left-
          click to view the entire
          current image on the Edit
          Grid, and at the highest
          possible zoom level; right-
          click to view the current
          Edit Grid image section
          only, at the highest
          possible zoom level - this
          will normally only be of
          use after altering the Edit
          Grid size, using the Arrow
          buttons. See:
C13H106     Arrow Buttons

          Note: Since using the
          Maximize button causes the
          highest possible zoom level
          to be used, this may mean a
          non-standard zoom level gets
          used which will be indicated
          by the fact that none of the
          pre-set Zoom buttons will be
          set.

          A set of four Arrow buttons
          are situated in the centre
          area of the screen, below
          the right side of the Edit
          Grid. They have dual
          functions, depending on
          which mouse button you click
          on them with: left-click to
          move the Edit Grid image
          view in the specified
          direction - this allows you
          to accurately position the
          Edit Grid view within the
          current image. Right-click
          to alter the Edit Grid size
          - the left and right arrows
          alter the width of the Edit
          Grid; up and down alters the
          depth.

          Tip: You can use the Image
          Display to directly set the
          Edit Grid size and position
          within the current image.
          See:
C13H107     Image Display

          Notice that pointing on the
          Arrow buttons causes the

          the Image Display.

          If the View/Image as Tile
          command has been checked,
          the Image Display area will
          be tiled with as many copies
          of the current image as will
          fit. See:
C13H031     Image as Tile
          However, only the top, left
          tile is considered the
          active Display Image which
          is used to point and click
          on in the various ways
          detailed below.

          The Edit Grid image section
          will be highlighted when
          pointing on the Image
          Display or when the View/
          Highlight On command has
          been checked. See:
C13H029     Highlight On

          The Image Display can also
          be used to directly set the
          Edit Grid image section:
          using the right mouse
          button, click or drag the
          Edit Grid highlight to the
          required position.

          You can specify the Edit
          Grid image section exactly
          by defining a rectangular
          area of the Image Display:
          left-click on one corner
          (the origin) and then move
          the mouse to the opposite
          corner - note that the size
          of the defined area is now
          displayed above the Image
          Display and that you can
          press the arrow keys to move
          the origin. Left-click a
          second time to make the
          defined area the Edit Grid
          image section - displayed on
          the Edit Grid at the highest
          possible zoom level. This
          may mean a non-standard zoom
          level gets used which will
          be indicated by the fact
          that none of the pre-set
          Zoom buttons will be set.

C14       Image Selector

          On the right side of the
          screen, directly below the
          Image Display, is the Image
          Selector input box.

          The Image Selector shows the
          current image number and can
          be used to select an image
          for editing: click on the
          +/- buttons to move through
          the available images - one
          at a time. Alternatively,
          click on the input box
          (between the +/- buttons) to
          make it active, then type
          the required image number
          and press ENTER.

          Tip: An image can also be
          selected for editing by
          choosing Image/Show All and
          then clicking on the
          required image. This can be

C14       Palette Tool Buttons

          By checking the View/Palette
          Tools menu command, this set
          of four buttons replace the
          usual Drawing Tool icon
          buttons at the top, left of
          the screen; below this, the
          RGB controls are displayed.
          Together, they comprise the
          Palette Tools which can be
          used to perform various
          operations on the 256
          available colours, providing
          full control over the
          current colour palette.

          Palette Tools:
C13H111     COPY
C13H112     GRAD
C13H113     RESET
C13H114     SCAN
C13H115     RGB Controls

          Note: The colour attributes
          0 to 15 - which comprise the
          top row of the Palette Grid
          - are used extensively by
          PIXELplus 256 itself and so
          cannot be altered (i.e. have
          their RGB values changed),
          as this could cause the
          display to become
          unreadable. However, they
          can be freely used in images
          in the same way any of the
          other 240 colours can, and
          as they represent a good
          range of colours anyway,
          this shouldn't become too
          much of a restriction. See:
C13H102     Palette Grid

          When the Palette Tools are
          being used, the function of
          the Edit Grid changes to
          allow colours to be selected
          in the same way as using the
          Palette Grid. See:

C14       COPY
C12       palette tool

          The COPY tool can be used to
          quickly duplicate an
          existing colour by copying
          it's RGB values to another
          colour attribute.

          While there's not usually
          any point in having two
          identical colours in the
          same palette, COPY can be
          useful when you want to
          create a colour that's a
          shade brighter or darker
          than an existing colour:
          after copying the colour,
          you can then make the
          required alterations to it
          by using the RGB Controls.
          See:
C13H115     RGB Controls

          COPY operates on the two
          selected colours by copying
          the Current Colour to the
          Secondary Colour, as
          indicated on the Selected
          Colour Boxes. See:
C13H099     Selected Colour Boxes
          So, to select the two
          colours involved correctly,
          first select the attribute
          you want to copy to by
          clicking on it with either
          mouse button, then select
          the actual colour you want
          to copy by clicking on it
          with the other mouse button.

          Note: While colour numbers
          0 to 15 can be copied, they
          cannot be copied to as they
          are used extensively by
          PIXELplus 256 itself.

C14       GRAD
C12       palette tool

          Use this powerful tool to
          automatically create a
          colour gradient - a
          contiguous set of attributes
          whose colours gradually
          blend from one colour into
          another.

          Tip: Creating a good
          selection of colour
          gradients can vastly improve
          the output produced by the
          various gradient Drawing
          Tools. See:
C13H084     Gradient Fill
C13H091     Gradient Circle/Ellipse
C13H094     Gradient Box
          This is also true of the
          palette-dependent special
          effects which rely heavily
          on the colours available in
          the current palette. See:
C13H068     BRIGHT
C13H069     DARK
C13H070     TINT
C13H073     SOFT
C13H074     UNZAG
C13H078     GREY

          GRAD works by creating a
          colour gradient that blends
          from the Current Colour to
          the Secondary Colour, as
          indicated on the Selected
          Colour Boxes. See:
C13H099     Selected Colour Boxes
          All attributes that come
          between the two selected
          colours will be used as part
          of the gradient. For
          example, if you have
          attributes 20 and 25
          selected, the resulting
          colour gradient will
          comprise attributes 20, 21,
          22, 23, 24, and 25. As such,
          the more attributes that
          come between the two
          selected colours, the
          smoother the transition from
          the first colour to the last
          colour will be.

          Tip: Before using the GRAD
          tool, it's a good idea to
          make sure that it won't
          affect any attributes that
          are already used in existing
          images (unless you
          specifically want it to).
          This can be achieved by
          using the SCAN tool. See:
C13H114     SCAN

C14       RESET
C12       palette tool

          Use the RESET tool to undo
          any unwanted changes you
          make to the current colour
          palette. If, for example,
          you use the GRAD tool to
          create a colour gradient
          that you then decide is
          wrong or that you don't
          need, using the RESET tool
          will return all the affected
          attributes to the colour
          they were before the GRAD
          tool was used.

          Note: The RESET tool must be
          used immediately after
          making any unwanted
          alterations to the current
          colour palette.

C12       palette tool

          Before making any changes to
          the current palette, it's
          often useful to know which
          of the 256 available colours
          (attributes) have not yet
          been used in images in the
          current image file. Directly
          or indirectly changing the
          RGB values of a colour
          attribute which has already
          been used will affect any
          images in which that colour
          attribute has been used.

          The SCAN tool searches
          through all the images in
          the current image file and
          marks the Palette Grid with
          a black and white dot, any
          colour attributes which have
          not yet been used. See:
C13H102     Palette Grid
          These colours are then free
          to alter without fear of
          affecting existing images.

C14       RGB Controls
C12       palette tool

          Each colour in the palette
          is made up from a mix of the
          three primary colours - red,
          green and blue (RGB). The
          RGB Controls show the
          individual red, green and
          blue values that make up the
          Current Colour, as indicated
          on the Selected Colour
          Boxes. See:
C13H099     Selected Colour Boxes
          These values can be altered
          by clicking on the
          appropriate +/- button.
          Valid settings range from 0
          to 63.

          A brightness control
          (represented by a small sun
          symbol) is also provided
          which can be used to simply
          increase or decrease all
          three RGB values together,
          which gives the appearance
          of altering the brightness
          of the affected colour.

          Note: Trying to increase the
          brightness of a colour when
          any of the RGB values are at
          their maximum (63), or
          trying to decrease the
          brightness when any of the
          RGB values are at their
          minimum (0), will have no
          effect. This is because all
          three RGB values must be
          able to change by the same
          amount in order to maintain
          the integrity of the actual
          colour.

          Tip: Before using the RGB
          Controls, it's a good idea
          to make sure that it won't
          affect an attribute that's
          already used in existing
          images (unless you
          specifically want it to).
          This can be achieved by
          using the SCAN tool. See:

C14       Animation Tester

          The Animation Tester is a
          simple utility that's
          integrated into the Image
          Editor so that, when
          creating images to be used
          as frames of animation, they
          can be viewed in sequence to
          test that the desired effect
          of animation is being
          achieved.

C14       Using the Animation Tester
          When using the Image Editor,
          you can enter the integrated
          Animation Tester by choosing
          View/Test Animation..., or
          by pressing F7.

          The screen is cleared and
          the "Test Animation" dialog
          box is displayed. From here,
          you can detail the animation
          sequence that you want to
          view.

          Specify the frames (images)
          to be used in the animation
          sequence by setting "First"
          to the initial image of the
          animation sequence, and
          "Last" to the final image of
          the animation sequence. Note
          that this defines a
          contiguous range of images
          so, for example, setting
          "First" to 1 and "Last" to 4
          will mean the animation will
          display images in the order
          1, 2, 3, 4. The specified
          sequence will then be
          repeated continuously when
          the animation is played.

          When using the +/- buttons
          to set the "First" or "Last"
          values (or when either input
          box is active), the denoted
          image is displayed in the
          preview box, on the right
          side of the dialog box,
          giving visual confirmation
          that the correct image has
          been selected. The size of
          the displayed image is also
          shown and can be used to
          check the size of images -
          normally, every image in the
          animation should be the same
          size to ensure the animation
          will run properly.

          Set "Repeat" to the number
          of times you want each image
          to be displayed before
          moving on to the next in the
          sequence.

          The speed of the animation
          can be controlled by setting
          "Delay" to the number of
          "delay periods" to wait
          between each frame update.

          Note: This "delay period"
          involves synchronizing the
          frame update with the
          monitor in order to achieve
          smooth, flicker-free
          animation. However, in
          certain situations, flicker
          may still occur or the
          animation may only be
          partially displayed or even
          not visible at all. This is
          because your computer can't
          update each frame of the
          animation quickly enough to
          keep up with the monitor
          synchronization. Problems
          will only usually occur if
          you have a slow computer
          system and are trying to
          animate large images at
          high speed. Increasing the
          "Delay" or reducing the size
          of images will usually help
          alleviate any problems. For
          further details, consult the
          PIXELplus 256 User's Manual
          where the topic of animation
          is covered extensively.

          Set "Advance" to the number
          of pixels you want the
          animation to move around the
          screen by, in the specified
          direction (see below). Set
          this to 0 to show a static
          animation (one that stays
          still and doesn't move

          This is a row of menu names
          running along the top of the
          screen.

          Note: Due to the nature of
          the Screen Designer (i.e.
          the entire screen area must
          be available to place design
          items on), the Menu Bar and
          Status Bar are not
          permanently displayed and
          can be turned on and off by
          clicking the right mouse
          button, or by pressing ENTER
          or ESCAPE.

          When the Menu Bar is
          showing, notice that the
          current screen design file
          name is displayed directly
          below it which will be shown
          as "Untitled" if it hasn't
          yet been saved to disk. The
          total number of design items

C14       Selecting a Menu Command
          Using the mouse, there are
          two ways to open a menu and
          select a command from it:

          1) Click on a menu name to
          open the menu, then click on
          the required menu command.
          To close the menu without
          choosing a command, click on
          the menu name a second time
          or click anywhere outside
          the menu.

          2) Drag down from the menu
          name to highlight the
          required command, then
          release the mouse button. To
          close the menu without
          choosing a command, simply
          drag off the menu (so that
          no command is highlighted)
          then release the mouse
          button.

          Note: While a menu command
          is highlighted, a brief
          description of that command
          is given on the Status Bar.
          See:
C13H166     Status Bar

C14       Command Notes:
          1) Commands that have an
          ellipsis (...) after them
          signify that further
          information must be supplied
          in order for the command to
          be carried out.
          2) Dimmed commands are
          unavailable at that time.
          3) Commands that have a
          check mark (Ä) to the left
          of them signify that the
          command is in effect.
          Selecting the command again
          removes the check mark and
          turns the command off.
          4) Some commands have key
          combinations to the right of
          them. At any time, pressing
          the listed keys selects the
          command without having to
          open the menu. See:

C14       New
C12       menu command

          Allows a new screen design
          to be created from scratch:
          the current screen design
          file is removed from memory
          and an "untitled" one is
          created containing no items.

          You will be prompted to save
          the current screen design
          file if it has been altered
          since it was last saved.

          If you want to create your
          new screen design using a
          different set of images to
          those currently loaded, you
          can do so by choosing the
          Load Images... command. See:

          Selecting this command
          allows an existing screen
          design file to be loaded
          into the Screen Designer,
          from disk.

          Note: The screen design file
          to be opened must be
          compatible with the
          currently loaded image file.
          For details, see:
C13H168     Introduction
          To open a screen design file
          that uses a different image
          file, select New and then
          the Load Images... command
          beforehand. See:
C13H120     New
C13H126     Load Images...

          The "Open Screen Design"
          dialog box is displayed
          containing a "File" input
          box, at the top, and a file
          list box below it. Use these
          to specify a file to open,
          as described below.

          Type a file name into the
          "File" input box and then
          press ENTER. If no file name
          extension is specified, the
          default for screen design
          files (.DES) is assumed.
          Alternatively, a file mask
          can be entered in order to
          list a specific group of
          files in the file list box.
          The default mask (*.DES) is
          used initially to list all
          files with a .DES extension.

          Simply double-clicking on a
          file name listed in the file
          list box is usually the
          easiest way to specify a
          file to open. Alternatively,
          highlight a listed file name
          by clicking on it, then
          click on the OK button.

          You can use the scroll bar
          provided to look through a
          list of files that's too
          long to display on a single
          "page".

C12       menu command

          Use this command to write
          the current screen design
          file to disk, effectively
          updating it with any changes
          made since it was last
          saved.

          If the current file has not
          been saved before, and so is
          "untitled", you will be
          asked to specify a name to
          save the file under, just as
          if you had selected the Save
          As... command.

          Tip: If you want to write a
          file to disk without
          overwriting the original
          version, you should save it
          under a different name by
          using the Save As...
          command. See:

          disk under a new name, thus
          keeping the original file
          unaltered.

          The "Save Design As" dialog
          box is displayed containing
          a single "File Name" input
          box; simply type the new
          file name here, then press
          ENTER. If no file name
          extension is specified, the

C12       menu command

          This command creates an
          ASCII text file containing a
          set of BASIC DATA statements
          that describe the current
          screen design.

          This type of DATA file can
          then be used to incorporate
          the screen design directly
          into your own BASIC
          programs. See the PIXELplus
          256 User's Manual for full
          details.

          The "Save Design As DATA"
          dialog box is displayed
          containing a single "File
          Name" input box; simply type
          the file name here, then
          press ENTER. If no file name
          extension is specified, the
          default for BASIC DATA files
          (.BAS) is assumed.

          Note: DATA files cannot be
          loaded into the Screen
          Designer for further
          editing. To save the current
          screen design in a format
          that can be opened by the

          that contains a pixel-for-
          pixel copy of the current
          screen design image.

          This type of screen design
          file can then be loaded
          directly back to the screen
          from within your own BASIC

C12       menu command

          This command allows you to
          load a different image file
          (created with the Image
          Editor) to use with the
          current screen design.

          Note: The image file to be
          loaded must be compatible
          with the current screen
          design. For details, see:
C13H168     Introduction
          If you want to use a
          different image file to
          create a new screen design
          from scratch, select the New
          command beforehand. See:
C13H120     New

          The "Load Images" dialog box
          is displayed so that a file
          can be specified. The usual
          "File" input box and file
          list box are shown and are
          functionally identical to
          those used by the Open...

          Tip: Any design items you

          design will be preserved on
          the Clipboard, even if you
          then open a different screen

C14       Snap to Grid
C12       menu command

          Enabling this command forces
          the Mouse Image to use the
          alignment grid: the top,
          left corner of the Mouse
          Image is automatically
          located (snapped) to the
          top, left corner of the
          nearest grid square. This
          makes it much easier to
          place design items in
          alignment.

          Note: The status of the
          Snap to Grid command also
          dictates the degree at which
          the Action/Shift commands
          operate. For details, see:

          is made visible. Note that
          the Mouse Image will only
          snap to the grid when the
          Snap to Grid command has
          been checked. See:
C13H138     Snap to Grid

          Note: When visible, the
          alignment grid may affect
          the appearance of some items
          in the current design. Use
          the Show Design command or
          turn the alignment grid off

C12       menu command

          This command should normally
          remain turned on (checked)
          as it causes selected items
          to be highlighted with a
          dotted, black and white
          outline. This is needed to
          distinguish any selected
          items from non-selected
          items. However, the
          highlights can be turned off
          if they get in the way of
          any operation you are trying
          to perform.

C14       Make Grid
C12       menu command

          Select this command to
          define a new alignment grid
          by specifying a rectangular
          area of screen to use as a
          single grid cell. Click on
          one corner (the origin) of
          the cell, then move the
          mouse to the opposite
          corner - note that the size
          of the defined area is now
          displayed at the top of the
          screen and that you can
          press the arrow keys to move
          the origin. Click a second
          time to set the grid cell;
          all other grid cells are
          then oriented around this.

          The Snap to Grid command is
          automatically enabled after
          successfully defining a new
          alignment grid. See:
C13H138     Snap to Grid

          Tip: Alternatively, you can
          directly set the alignment
          grid to the current Mouse
          Image position and size by
          pressing SHIFT+F6.

          when working with a screen
          design that contains a great
          many items.

          Note: Any alteration made to
          the "Step Rate" setting will
          remain in effect until
          explicitly changed. This is
          true even when restarting
          the Screen Designer as the

C14       Introduction

          The PIXELplus 256 Image
          Editor makes it easy to
          create professional quality
          bitmapped graphics in 256
          colours, such as sprites,
          icons, character sets,
          animations etc. These can
          then be used in your own
          BASIC programs that use the
          popular 320x200 VGA screen
          mode (SCREEN 13).

          Using the Image Editor is
          made simple due to it's
          friendly user interface:

C13H005     Graphical User Interface
C13H006     Pull-down Menus
C13H004     Simple Keyboard Commands

          The many powerful tools and
          features available make
          creating quality graphics
          easy:
C13H064     18 Flexible Drawing Tools
C13H067     14 Special Effects
C13H110     Colour Palette Tools
C13H116     Animation Tester

C14       Getting Started
          When you first use the
          Image Editor, you are
          automatically supplied with
          an untitled image file
          containing a single, blank
          image. If necessary, this
          100x100 image can then be
          resized by selecting the
          Image/Resize... command.
          See:
C13H051     Resize...

          You can now start designing
          your first image by clicking
          on a Drawing Tool icon
          button - located at the top,
          left corner of the screen -
          and then use the selected
          tool on the Edit Grid, in
          the centre of the screen. If
          necessary, the magnification
          of the Edit Grid can be
          changed to a more manageable
          level by clicking on the
          Zoom buttons, situated
          directly below the Edit
          Grid. For details, See:
C13H064     Drawing Tool Icon Buttons
C13H103     Edit Grid
C13H105     Zoom Buttons

          Tip: Clicking repeatedly on
          some Drawing Tool icon
          buttons will cause other
          related tools to become
          available.

          You can choose the colours
          you want to use by selecting
          them from the Palette Grid,
          located at the bottom, left
          corner of the screen. See:
C13H102     Palette Grid
          Colours can also be altered
          by using the Palette Tools:
          simply select View/Palette
          Tools to have the Drawing
          Tools replaced with the
          Palette Tools. See:
C13H110     Palette Tool Buttons

          Continue designing your
          image in this way, as well
          as utilizing the various
          menu and keyboard commands
          available. See:
C13H006     Menu Commands
C13H004     Keyboard Commands
          To create additional images,
          choose Image/Add... to
          create one or more new,
          blank images, or choose
          Image/Duplicate... to make a
          copy of one or more existing
          images. See:
C13H049     Add...
C13H052     Duplicate...

          When ready, your file of
          images can be saved to disk
          and incorporated into your
          own BASIC programs, in a
          number of different ways.

C14       Introduction

          The PIXELplus 256 Screen
          Designer makes it easy to
          compose screen layouts -
          game levels, title screens
          etc. - using images created
          with the Image Editor. This
          saves you having to work out
          the actual screen
          coordinates of where you
          want each and every design
          item (image) displayed.

          Using the Screen Designer is
          made simple due to it's
          friendly user interface:
C13H171     Full Mouse Control
C13H118     Pull-down Menus
C13H117     Simple Keyboard Commands

C14       Getting Started
          Before you can start
          designing a screen layout,
          you must first load the
          images you want to use. If
          you invoked the Screen
          Designer from within the
          Image Editor (by selecting
          View/Screen Designer...),
          then the image file you had
          open in the Image Editor is
          automatically loaded,
          otherwise you will be
          presented with the "Load
          Images" dialog box, where
          you can specify the image
          file that you want to use.
          For details, see:
C13H126     Load Images...

          Next, choose Image/Show All
          to view all the available
          images, then point and click
          on the image you want to
          start designing with. See:
C13H159     Show All
          The selected image (known as
          the Mouse Image) can then be
          positioned anywhere on the
          screen by moving the mouse
          and clicking it in place -
          images you add to your
          design are referred to as
          design items. You can also
          choose a display action to
          use when adding items to
          your design by selecting one
          from the Image menu. See:
C13H152     Image Menu
C13H170     Display Actions

          Tip: You can press the < and
          > keys to select a different
          Mouse Image, on-the-fly.
          Keys 1 through 6 can be used
          to select a different
          display action.

          Notice that the Menu Bar
          (and Status Bar) is removed
          to give access to the entire
          screen. Items can only be
          added to your design when
          the Menu Bar is not showing.
          Simply, click the right
          mouse button to show/hide
          the Menu Bar.

          Continue to build-up your
          screen design in this way
          as well as utilizing the
          various menu and keyboard
          commands available. See:
C13H118     Menu Commands
C13H117     Keyboard Commands
          You can move backwards and
          forwards through the
          "string" of screen design
          items by pressing the left
          and right arrow keys, or by
          pressing PAGE UP and PAGE
          DOWN to step quickly through
          the design items. This
          allows you to insert new
          items or access existing
          items that you want to
          affect in some way - delete,
          shift etc.

          When ready, your screen
          design can be saved to disk
          and incorporated into your
          own BASIC programs, in a
          number of different ways.

          Consult the PIXELplus 256
          User's Manual for full
          Screen Designer details.

C14       File Association and
C14       Compatibility
          When saving a screen design
          to disk, it's important to
          realize that no link or
          association is maintained
          between the screen design
          file and the image file that
          was used to design it. This
          gives you the freedom to
          load and use any image file
          with any compatible screen
          design file. For an image
          file and screen design file
          to be compatible, they must
          comply to the two following
          criteria:

          1) The image file must at
          least contain the same
          number of images as used in
          the screen design, e.g. if
          the highest image number
          used in the screen design is
          10 then the image file used
          must contain at least 10
          images - a screen design
          can't display an image that
          doesn't exist.

          2) Each and every design
          item (image) in the screen
          design must be fully
          displayable without going
          off the edge of the screen.

          Note: Given the above points
          on compatibility, it's
          advised that you do not make
          any significant alterations
          to any image file that you
          have used to create a screen
          design with, as this could
          cause the image file to
          become incompatible. In
          particular, deleting or
          resizing one or more images
          in such a file could cause
          problems.

          Tip: A simple way to
          remember which image file
          was used to create a screen
          design is to give the screen
          design file the same base
          name as the image file, when
          you save it to disk. For
          example, if you create a
          design using the
          GAMEOVER.PUT image file,
          save the screen design file
          as GAMEOVER.DES.

C14       Save as DATA...
C12       menu command

          This command creates an
          ASCII text file containing a
          set of BASIC DATA statements
          that describe the images in
          the current file. A further
          set of palette DATA
          statements are also included
          if the current image file
          uses a non-standard colour
          palette.

          This type of DATA file can
          then be used to incorporate
          the images directly into
          your own BASIC programs. See
          the PIXELplus 256 User's
          Manual for full details.

          The "Save Image File As
          DATA" dialog box is
          displayed containing a
          single "File Name" input
          box; simply type the file
          name here, then press ENTER.
          If no file name extension is
          specified, the default for
          BASIC DATA files (.BAS) is
          assumed.

          Note: DATA files cannot be
          loaded into the Image Editor
          for further editing. To save
          the current image file in a
          format that can be opened by
          the Image Editor, see:

          SCREEN DESIGNER
C14       Display Actions

          In your own BASIC programs,
          each design item (image)
          will be displayed on the
          screen using the
          PUT(graphics) statement
          which displays an image
          using one of five display
          actions - PSET, PRESET, OR,
          XOR, AND. Consequently, the
          Screen Designer itself
          allows you to select a
          display action to use when
          placing design items on the
          screen. See:
C13H152     Image Menu

          A sixth option (MASK) is
          also provided which isn't a
          true display action but can
          be used in the Screen
          Designer to cause design
          items to be placed on-screen
          using an additional mask
          image.

          There now follows a complete
          description of the six
          display actions that can be
          used when placing design
          items on the screen in the
          Screen Designer.

C14       PSET
          Causes a design item to be
          placed on the screen so that
          it completely overwrites any
          existing image.

C14       PRESET
          Causes a design item to be
          logically inverted before
          being placed on the screen,
          overwriting any existing
          image.

          The colour number
          (attribute) of each pixel in
          the image is logically
          inverted which results in a
          different colour number
          being used when displaying
          the pixel. For example:

          Original colour number
          of image pixel:
C15       0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1 = 15

          Result: colour number
          of displayed pixel:
C15       1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0 = 240

C14       OR
          A logical OR operation is
          performed between the design
          item and the existing screen
          image.

          The colour number
          (attribute) of each pixel in
          the image is ORed with the
          corresponding screen pixel;
          the resulting value is the
          colour number used to
          display the pixel. For
          example:

          Colour number of
          image pixel:
C15       1  0  1  0  1  0  1  0 = 170

                     OR

          Colour number of
          corresponding screen pixel:
C15       1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0 = 240

          Result: colour number
          of displayed pixel:
C15       1  1  1  1  1  0  1  0 = 250

C14       XOR
          A logical XOR (exclusive OR)
          operation is performed
          between the design item and
          the existing screen image.

          The colour number
          (attribute) of each pixel in
          the image is XORed with the
          corresponding screen pixel;
          the resulting value is the
          colour number used to
          display the pixel. For
          example:

          Colour number of
          image pixel:
C15       1  0  1  0  1  0  1  0 = 170

                     XOR

          Colour number of
          corresponding screen pixel:
C15       1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0 = 240

          Result: colour number
          of displayed pixel:
C15       0  1  0  1  1  0  1  0 = 90

C14       AND
          A logical AND operation is
          performed between the design
          item and the existing screen
          image.

          The colour number
          (attribute) of each pixel in
          the image is ANDed with the
          corresponding screen pixel;
          the resulting value is the
          colour number used to
          display the pixel. For
          example:

          Colour number of
          image pixel:
C15       1  0  1  0  1  0  1  0 = 170

                     AND

          Colour number of
          corresponding screen pixel:
C15       1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0 = 240

          Result: colour number
          of displayed pixel:
C15       1  0  1  0  0  0  0  0 = 160

C14       MASK
          This is a special display
          action which causes a design
          item to be placed on the
          screen so that only the
          item's exact shape is
          displayed, allowing the
          background image to still be
          visible around it. In order
          to achieve this, an
          additional mask image is
          required: the image coming
          directly after the Mouse
          Image (in the currently
          loaded image file) is
          assumed to be the
          corresponding mask image -
          created using the Image
          Editor's Convert to Mask...
          command. For details, see:
C13H053     Convert to Mask...
          For example, if you have
          image number 10 selected as
          the current Mouse Image,
          then image number 11 is
          assumed to be the
          corresponding mask image.

          When using the MASK display
          action, the mask image is
          first placed on the screen
          using the AND display
          action, then the actual
          Mouse Image is placed on
          top, using the OR display
          action.

          Note: Placing design items
          using the MASK display
          action actually causes two
          items to be placed at a
          time. Using MASK simply
          makes it easier to place
          design items using a mask
          image - the same effect
          could be achieved by first
          placing the mask image using
          the AND display action, and
          then placing the actual
          image on top of it using the
          OR display action.

          The use of mask images and
          the masking technique is
          discussed fully in the
          PIXELplus 256 User's Manual.

          PIXELplus 256
C14       Using the Mouse

          PIXELplus 256 requires the
          use of a mouse pointing
          device and makes extensive
          use of both the left and
          right mouse buttons. This
          makes using PIXELplus 256
          easier and more intuitive
          than using just the
          keyboard. Terms used to
          describe how to use the
          mouse are detailed below:

C14       Left-click (or just click)
          Quickly press and release
          the left mouse button.

          The term "click" on its own
          also refers to clicking
          using the left mouse button,
          e.g. "Click on the OK
          button" means point and
          click on the OK button,
          using the left mouse button.

C14       Right-click
          Quickly press and release
          the right mouse button.

C14       Double-click
          Press and release the left
          mouse button twice in rapid
          succession.

          The term "double-click"
          always refers to using the
          left mouse button as no
          operation in PIXELplus 256
          requires you to double-click
          using the right mouse
          button.

C14       Drag
          Press and hold down the
          mouse button while moving
          the mouse.

          Different dragging
          operations will require
          either the left or right
          mouse button to be used. The
          left mouse button should be
          used for dragging when no
          button is specified, e.g.
          "Drag down from the menu
          name".
