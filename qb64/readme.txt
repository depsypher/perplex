===============
-DECLARE CUSTOMTYPE LIBRARY (no arguments) patched (was trying to locate call in nonexistant library file)

V0.94 Specific
==============
-DECLARE LIBRARY significantly improved:
 -_OFFSET integer variable type implemented for the storage of pointers and offsets which varies across systems/implementations and will grow in the future
 -DECLARE CUSTOMTYPE LIBRARY, allows you to override the required types and use the variable types you want, provided they are the same size
 -DECLARE STATIC LIBRARY, for specifying static linking over shared library linking
 -Added DECLARE LIBRARY support to MacOSX & Linux including library versioning

V0.936 Specific
===============
-Implements the QB64 device interface which can handle joystick, keyboard and mouse input in a common way by referring to buttons, axes & wheels
 Example usage:[http://www.qb64.net/forum/index.php?topic=3585.msg36876#msg36876]
-Implemented QBASIC's STICK, STRIG and ON STRIG functionality
 Example usage:[http://www.qb64.net/forum/index.php?topic=3585.msg37802#msg37802]
-Fixed problem with _CONNECTIONADDRESS$ returning 'localhost' IP (external site this function relied on changed their procedure)

 -Clipping bugs which caused program to crash fixed
 -_MAPTRIANGLE _SEAMLESS ... option added so common edges aren't drawn twice, affecting alpha dependent results
 -Limits (-16383 to 16383) on coordinate positions imposed, as this is a software mapper for speed reasons it has some limitations
-_SETALPHA fixed (was broken by syntax checking upgrade)

V0.934 Specific
===============
-Fixed the critical problem which made the IDE freeze/crash after a period of usage
 (Depending on the OS and RAM, the period could have been as short as a few minutes!)

-New command added: _MAPTRIANGLE
 Calling syntax:
 _MAPTRIANGLE (10,10)-(10,20)-(20,20)[,sourceimage] TO (10,10)-(10,20)-(20,20)[,destimage]
 What does it do?
 It texture maps a triangular region from the source image onto the destination image.
 What's supported:
 -8bit, 32bit, _CLEARCOLOR and alpha
 Notes:
 A software mapper, but an extrememly fast one. Could easily be used to make an image rotator

V0.932 Specific
===============
This is an essential update which corrects problems added by V0.931

         -MacOSX: Apple(Command)+X/C/V/A also supported in IDE
         -MacOSX: CTRL+BREAK now works (CTRL+F15 on keyboards without a designated 'break' key)
         -(Linux too?)/MacOSX: TIMER now begins on the correct value, before it always started on the same value which also made RANDOMIZE TIMER do nothing!
        Bugs/Incompatibilities:
         -Severe memory leak related to GET/PUT fixed
         -Other minor bugs/incompatibilities have also been addressed

[0.925] Launch of QB64 for MacOSX:
        -MacOSX users must install Apple's 'Xcode' for C++ compilation before running 'setup.command'
         (http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html)
        -Users with 32-bit processors should copy qb64\common\libfreetype_alternatives\tiger_32bit\libfreetype.6.3.dylib over qb64\common\libfreetype.6.dylib if having difficulties
        -Created executable programs are portable between like OSX systems by copying the executable file as well as the 'common' folder
        -To help launch executables without a console, a helper file called 'programname_start.command' is created along with the executable
[0.925] QB64 32-bit and 64-bit Linux versions have been joined by catering for minor differences
[0.925] Windows users should note that 0.925 was a Linux & MacOSX only release

        -Returning STRING types (converts a NULL terminated char*)
        -Passing user defined TYPES (passes as a void*)	
        -Specifying a file path in the library name
        -Error report when required DLL not present at runtime
        -Error report when declared function not present in DLL library at runtime
        -Direct passing of pointers between library functions (allows for passing pointers with helper functions)
        -Many bugs in DECLARE LIBRARY fixed
[0.924] 'SELECT CASE INKEY$' problem fixed [http://www.qb64.net/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=ope93cs4q1imq0qp0cvhk07ft3&topic=1930.0]

[0.922] New command: _MAPUNICODE unicodevalue TO asciivalue 'Maps UNICODE codes to ASCII values for purposes such as simulating codepages
[0.922] New command: unicodevalue=_MAPUNICODE(asciivalue) 'Returns the UNICODE code that the ascii value is currently mapped to
[0.922] Linux version updated
[0.922] Significant bugs/incompatibilities corrected, including:
        -corrections to the passing of UDT members by reference
        -fixed memory leak in _FREEIMAGE (as _FREEIMAGE is called internally by QB64 for SCREEN management, it also affected some programs not calling _FREEIMAGE)
	-corrected mismatch in dimension count of multidimensional arrays passed to functions
	-corrections to the implementation of the FIELD statement
        (for other bugs/incompatibilities addressed, refer to the forum)
[0.921] Various bug fixes and patches applied to V0.92

V0.92 Specific
==============
-Significant improvements to the QB64 input system have occurred primarily for multilingual and multiplatform reasons:
 i)   The new _KEYHIT and _KEYDOWN functions can be used to monitor key press/release events/states.
      These also return UNICODE (UTF32) codes when UNICODE characters are entered.
      [http://www.qb64.net/forum/index.php?topic=1368.msg12703#msg12703]
 ii)  IME support added to facilitate entering Japanese, Chinese and Korean characters.
      Note: The font CYBERBIT.TTF is free for non-commercial usage is now included in QB64.
            It is only required to facilitate input via IME and not loaded unless the user switches to an IME input system mode.
            QB64 also locates several fall-back fonts under circumstances when 'cyberbit' is not present,
            therefore it is unnecessary to distribute this font with your programs.
 iii) QB64 now maps the UNICODE input of characters which appear in the CP437 extended range(128-255) to their correct character.
      This means characters with umlauts and other international characters now appear correctly when using INKEY$
 iv)  QB64 emulates scancodes based on what a stock-standard 101-key keyboard might return.
      Scancodes are language/platform specific, so this change means programs which do use INP will work as expected on all platforms.
-Support for the FIELD statement added.
-Some bugs/incompatibilities addressed but others will be corrected over coming weeks via automatic updates.
 (See the bugs/incompatibilities forum for further information)

-Many bugs/incompatibilities fixed

V0.871 Specific
===============
Minor update to fix a locking problem.

V0.87 Specific
==============
Primarily changes the internal process used by QB64 to access files giving QB64 greater OS-specific control when available:
-LOCK/UNLOCK implemented
-More specific errors such as "Path not found" (instead of "File not found") occur, as in QBASIC
Note: V0.87 contains few (if any) bug fixes since the previous release and implementing the above was
      the only goal. In 2 weeks time V0.871 will be released and address any recently reported bugs
      or problems.

V0.86 Specific
==============
Primarily improves the QB64 IDE with:
-CTRL+C/V/X alternatives for copy,paste,cut
-User selectable font (any monospace TTF font), font size and window dimensions
-Auto-spacing and capitalization complete with the only exceptions (which will be addressed soon) being:
 CONST equations like CONST A=B+1
 DATA statements
 Lines ending with a colon
 DECLARE statements (completely ignored by QB64)
 Line labels are kept in the same case as they are typed

Other changes:
-GCC compiler updated latest TDM version
-Changes to generated C++ code makes C++ compiling large .BAS programs much faster and results in a smaller .EXE file
 Some larger .BAS programs which previously froze/failed the C++ compilation process now compile OK
-ON TIMER interval corrected
-_CLIPBOARD sub changed to avoid reported freeze/GPF on some systems
-Many other reported (and unreported) bugs are fixed. (Some minor issues, such as specific error codes and VAL oddities will be addressed soon)

V0.851 Specific
===============
-Programs now resolve their own directory regardless of how/where they are run from (caused many 'file not found' problems)
-ON TIMER (and related commands) added [http://www.qb64.net/forum/index.php?topic=572.0]
-CHAIN now preserves the screen state and manages path/directory issues [http://www.qb64.net/forum/index.php?topic=517.0]
-_MOUSEWHEEL function added [http://www.qb64.net/forum/index.php?topic=595.0]
-_FULLSCREEN command (sub & function) added to control full screen mode [http://www.qb64.net/forum/index.php?topic=581.0]
-"OPTIONS" menu added to the IDE to control/disable auto-format and/or auto-indent
-New options in the IDE "RUN" menu added (make .EXE only & start detached)
-Auto-indent improved
-Lots of great extra samples programs added to try
-Many significant bugs/problems have been fixed

V0.85 Specific
==============
Major stages in the exciting transition to IDE autoformatting and autolayout are complete.
Code will auto-indent.
The spacing of some statements will be done by autolayout.
The capitalization of some names will be maintained by autolayout.
This release has no option to disable the above yet.
Every effort has been made to make sure autolayout/autoformat do not damage your code.
If you encounter a problem related to autolayout/autoformatting please report it immediately.

* NOTE: The QB64 IDE now uses the Windows clipboard for copy/paste operations (this is very useful)
* CHAIN implemented (maintains COMMON data but doesn't maintain open files or the screen state yet)
* _CLIPBOARD$ string added to use/access the Windows clipboard
  PRINT _CLIPBOARD$ 'prints the contents of the clipboard
  _CLIPBOARD$="This is line 1"+CHR$(13)+CHR$(10)+"This is line 2" 'sets 2 lines of text in the clipboard
* _EXIT function implemented to let a program know if the user has used the close button or CTRL+BREAK
  After the first time this function is called, the programmer can no longer manually exit the program.
  _EXIT returns 0 - no exit request made
                1 - exit via X box
                2 - exit via CTRL+BREAK
                3 - both CTRL+BREAK and the X box have been used since last call
* Some sample programs (eg. samples\original\qb64\ripples.bas) stopped working (across several releases) and the various causes have been fixed
* Many reported (and unreported) bugs have been fixed

V0.841b Specific

t=TIMER(0.001) 'returns TIMER value rounded to nearest 0.001 of a second (highest accuracy possible is to the nearest millisecond)
_DISPLAY (no parameters) 'This command manually updates the monitor using the data of the currently selected display page. The command also disables the autodisplay of display page data to the monitor (the default) if it is on.
_AUTODISPLAY (no parameters) 'This command enables autodisplay so the display page data will automatically be updated to the monitor.
x=_ERRORLINE 'Returns the source code line number that caused the most recent runtime error

Added support for QBASIC commands:

V0.83 Specific
==============
Primarily improves cross-platform support.
1) Windows 98/ME support restored (broken since late 2008!)
2) Linux support improved:
 -_INTEGER64 data type now supported (C++ compilation failed before)
 -READing numbers from DATA statements fixed
 -EOF() not being detected problem fixed
 -\ automatically changed to / in OPEN,BLOAD,KILL,CHDIR,etc.
 (Many sample programs now run correctly as a result of these changes)
3) Many bug fixes to compiler & IDE;
  Of note:
 -Incorrect errors were reported when editing programs conatining user defined types in the IDE
 -GET from file treats # as optional
 
V0.82 Specific
==============
Primarily implements:
1) PRINT USING [#] command
2) STATIC command (all usages)
3) Major bug fixes to the QB64 IDE
4) Major bug fixes and improvements to the QB64 compiler
This is a Windows only release of V0.82, a Linux version will become available in 1-2 weeks time.

V0.81x Specific
===============
V0.81x implements 2 major changes:
1) Provides an IDE remarkably similar (in look and interface) to the QBASIC IDE called qb64.exe
notes:
-qb64.exe can perform command line compilation (similar to previous versions of QB64) using the -c switch, for example:
 qb64 -c mycode.bas
-many bugs/issues remain to be fixed, report them in the forum (gripes are ok too!)
-many more features are planned, at present the IDE is essentially a text editor that checks your code as you type it
-code may have "OK" status but fail C++ compilation (on F5) due to the underlying QB64 compiler not checking code thouroughly enough
-programs using the underscore (_) symbol for line don't work in the IDE yet
-the IDE features an autosave feature which silently saves your code after every 10 changes, you will be automatically prompted to restore this upon restart if you didn't exit normally (via the file menu's "exit" command)
-C++ compilation failure and some preprocessing errors are reported with incorrect line numbers, which can be misleading

2) Linux support
notes:
-you must have downloaded the Linux version of QB64 from the qb64.net forums and followed necessary installation steps
-64 bit Linux systems are not supported yet (it may be possible to edit ./internal/c/makeline.txt to force compilation for a 32-bit system)
-EOF() doesn't work correctly
-Type _UNSIGNED INTEGER64 (only the unsigned version) cannot be used due to an incompatibility
-check forward slashes and backslashes are correct for the Linux filesystem (QB64 will address this automatically in later versions)
-check case of referenced filenames carefully (QB64 will address this automatically in later versions)
-unhandled (ie. not handled by ON ERROR GOTO ...) errors when your code is running currently result in immediate program termination without warning
-lots of other compatibility problems exist and will be fixed in later versions, report them in the forum

general notes about V0.81x:
-compile.exe is not in V0.81x but will be provided alongside qb64.exe in subsequent versions
-temporarily removed support for SETTING the time/date

V0.81 Specific
==============
V0.81 primarily implements support for constants (refer to the CONST keyword)
Handling of numbers written in the code has been improved to support all type symbol extensions (even the newer QB64 types), this also applies to &H..., &O... and the newly implemented binary prefix &B... (note that &B... only currently works when used with numbers directly in your code, further support for &B... will be added later). This provides better compatibility with QBASIC's handling of numbers.
Several bugs causing compilation to fail on valid code have been corrected, but always check that the program to be compiled doesn't include any as yet unimplemented features listed later in this document.
No new sample programs have been added in this release.

V0.8 Specific
=============
V0.8 primarily implements the QB64 2D prototype 1.0, a fully integrated 2D graphics interface which encapsulates and extends upon QBASIC's standard graphics capabilities. It incorporates .TGA .BMP .PNM .XPM .XCF .PCX .GIF .JPG .TIF .LBM .PNG graphics formats, .TTF (true type) fonts, 32-bit RGBA, alpha blended drawing, color-key'd palette indexed images, RGB to palette matching, stretching, flipping, mirroring, and other functionality. Multiple graphics surfaces can be used of differing dimensions and formats simultaneously, and operations can be performed any these surfaces interchangeably.

The 2D prototype is fully implemented but still in the process of being documented in detail. Please refer to the following webpage for the latest documentation:
http://www.qb64.net/2d
Feel free to enquire about the 2D prototype & its usage at:
http://www.network54.com/Forum/585676/
No official example programs are available which demonstrate the 2D prototype yet, however they will be released soon.



Thanks for trying QB64!
The goal of QB64 is to create programs from BASIC source for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux whilst being 100% compatible with Microsoft QBASIC/QB4.5

Make sure original .BAS files from QB4.5 are saved in text format not the compressed file format.

Read \qb64\samples\info.txt for information about included .BAS example programs.

UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES
======================
The majority of QBASIC commands are implemented.
Only the following are NOT IMPLEMENTED yet:
 -Some ON ... GOTO/GOSUB EVENTS (ON ERROR & ON TIMER are both implemented)
 -Devices (SCRN:,LPT...,KYBD:,CONS:) in an OPEN statement
 -CALL INTERRUPT (QB64 only supports INT 33h)
 -CALL ABSOLUTE (QB64 only has support for PUSH/POP/MOV/RET/INT 33h)
 -Port access ((QB64 only supports OUT &H3C8/&H3C9 and INP &H3DA/&H60)
 -Multimodular support
 -Other commands: TRON/TROFF, FILEATTR, IOCTL, IOCTL$, PEN, STICK, STRIG, SETMEM, FRE, KEY ON, PALETTE USING (note: PALETTE is implemented)

QB64 SPECIFIC FEATURES (FEATURES THAT QBASIC DOES NOT HAVE)
===========================================================

INPUT Protection
----------------
"Intelligently" restricts keyboard input. Avoids "redo from start" messages. Limits screen space used by input for fixed length strings and numbers (eg. INTEGER cannot use more than 6 spaces)

New Data Types
--------------
_BIT			name` or name`1
_UNSIGNED _BIT		name~` or name~`1

_UNSIGNED _BIT*4	name~`4
_BYTE			name%%
_UNSIGNED _BYTE		name~%%
INTEGER			name%
_UNSIGNED INTEGER	name~%

STRING*100		name$100

_DEFINE Command
---------------
Instead of having DEFBIT,DEFUBT,DEFBYT,DEFUBY etc. for all the new data types there is a simple command which can be used like DEFINT for new types (or old types if you want to) as follows:
_DEFINE A-C,Z AS DOUBLE 'the same as DEFDBL A-C,Z

Larger Maximum RANDOM File Access Field Sizes
---------------------------------------------
For RANDOM access files, record lengths can now be greater than 32767 bytes. Variable length string headers allow for larger strings whilst still being 100% QBASIC compatible with smaller strings.

BLOAD/BSAVE Limit
-----------------
Can save/load 65536 bytes, not just 65535.

_MK$(variable-type,value)
-------------------------
Like MKI$/MKS$/etc., this converts numbers into a binary string. The advantage of _MK$() is it allows conversion into the newer QB64 data types as apose to just the QBASIC types. Example usage:
a$=_MK$(_UNSIGNED _INTEGER64,100)
Note: _CV(variable-type,string) can also be used.

_ROUND 
------
This can be used to round values to integers (CINT & CLNG imposed limitations on the output)

Graphics GET/PUT
----------------
GET supports a new optional argument. If used the area to store can be partially/all off-screen and off-screen pixels are set to the value specified:
GET (-10,-10)-(10,10),a,3
PUT format has been extended to PUT[{STEP}](?,?),?[,[{_CLIP}][{PSET|PRESET|AND|OR|XOR}][,?]] where _CLIP allows drawing partially/all off-screen and the final optional argument can specify a mask color to skip when drawing.

Better Sound/Audio Support
--------------------------
Support for playing .MID, .WAV, .MP3 and many other formats.
Commands include:
_SNDPLAYFILE		Simple command to play a sound file (with limited options)
_SNDOPEN		Returns a handle to a sound file
_SNDCLOSE		Unloads a sound file (waits until after it has finished playing)
_SNDPLAY		Plays a sound
_SNDSTOP		Stops a playing (or paused) sound
_SNDPLAYING		Returns whether a sound is being played
_SNDLOOP		Like _SNDPLAY but sound is looped
_SNDLIMIT		Stops playing a sound after it has been playing for a set number of seconds
_SNDGETPOS		Returns to current playing position in seconds
_SNDCOPY		Copies a sound (so two or more of the same sound can be played at once)
_SNDPLAYCOPY		Copies a sound, plays it and automatically closes the copy
_SNDPAUSE		Pauses a sound
_SNDPAUSED		Checks if a sound is paused
_SNDLEN			Returns the length of a sound in seconds
_SNDVOL			Sets the volume of a sound
_SNDBAL			Sets the balance/3D position of a sound
_SNDSETPOS		Changes the current/starting playing position of a sound in seconds
For more information, read "AUDIO.TXT" in your "QB64" folder.
Also check out "AUDIO.BAS" in the samples folder, you'll need some audio files to test this with!

Mouse Support
-------------
_MOUSESHOW		Displays the mouse cursor (sub)
_MOUSEHIDE		Hides the mouse cursor (sub)
_MOUSEINPUT		MUST BE CALLED UNTIL IT RETURNS 0, it reads the next mouse message and returns -1 if new information was available otherwise 0 (func)
_MOUSEX			(func)
_MOUSEY			(func)
_MOUSEBUTTON(n)		-1 if button n (a value of 1 or more) is down

Improved 2D Graphics Support
----------------------------
Although not fully documented, these new 2D commands are fully implemented.
