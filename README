This is the MS Quickbasic source for a game I wrote in 1991 when I was 15 years old.

I rescued it off a floppy disk and put it up on github for all those recruiters out there to see. I'm betting on a huge Quickbasic revival after php, ruby et al. have run their course. I'll be so marketable with 20+ years of Quickbasic experience! Just waiting for that gravy train to roll in now...
